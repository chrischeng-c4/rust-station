//! TUI interface for rstn development toolkit
//!
//! This crate provides the terminal user interface layer,
//! delegating all business logic to rstn-core.
//!
//! The TUI will be migrated from crates/rstn/src/tui/ in Phase 2.

// Modules will be migrated from rstn/src/tui/ during Phase 2
// pub mod app;
// pub mod event;
// pub mod views;

// Placeholder for now - will export TUI components after migration
pub fn placeholder() {
    println!("rstn-tui placeholder - TUI migration in progress");
}
