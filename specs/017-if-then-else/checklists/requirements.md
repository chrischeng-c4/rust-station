# Specification Quality Checklist: Conditional Control Flow (if/then/else/elif/fi)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-06
**Feature**: [Conditional Control Flow (if/then/else/elif/fi)](/specs/015-if-then-else/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (basic if, else, elif, compound, test integration, nesting)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All items completed. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` and `/speckit.plan`.

- 6 user stories cover complete feature scope (P1 and P2 priorities)
- 13 functional requirements are testable and specific
- 5 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Edge cases well documented
- Dependencies clearly identified (none)
- Blocking relationships noted

**Specification status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING
